# unity-websocket-webgl

Hybrid event-driven WebSocket implementation for Unity 3D.

It automatically compiles browser or native implementation based on project's target platform. Native implementation is using [WebSocketSharp](https://github.com/sta/websocket-sharp) library (must be downloaded separately - see below). For the browser implementation the custom emscripten JSLIB is used.

**Warning:** WebSocket client is intended to support only binary messages. So if you want to send or receive string messages you must convert it to/from byte array in your code.

## Downloading WebSocketSharp

You can get `WebSocketSharp.dll` from NuGet package manager. See [NuGet Gallery: websocket-sharp](http://www.nuget.org/packages/WebSocketSharp).

Library can be installed manually. Just download the NuGet package. Then rename the file extension from `.nupkg` to `.zip` and extract it. Now you can copy `lib/websocket-sharp.dll` file to your Unity project into the `Assets/Plugins` directory.

For more info please visit official [WebSocketSharp GitHub repo](https://github.com/sta/websocket-sharp).

## Installing plugin

To install this plugin just copy the contents of `Plugins` directory to your Unity project's `Assets/Plugins` directory.

## Usage

For example usage see `Scripts/WebSocketDemo.cs` file. You can import it to your project and assign it to any GameObject. Then run your project and check the console.

```csharp
using System.Collections;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Text;
using UnityEngine;

// Use plugin namespace
using HybridWebSocket;

public class WebSocketDemo : MonoBehaviour {

    // Use this for initialization
    void Start () {

        // Create WebSocket instance
        WebSocket ws = WebSocketFactory.CreateInstance("ws://echo.websocket.org");

        // Add OnOpen event listener
        ws.OnOpen += () =>
        {
            Debug.Log("WS connected!");
            Debug.Log("WS state: " + ws.GetState().ToString());

            ws.Send(Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes("Hello from Unity 3D!"));
        };

        // Add OnMessage event listener
        ws.OnMessage += (byte[] msg) =>
        {
            Debug.Log("WS received message: " + Encoding.UTF8.GetString(msg));

            ws.Close();
        };

        // Add OnError event listener
        ws.OnError += (string errMsg) =>
        {
            Debug.Log("WS error: " + errMsg);
        };

        // Add OnClose event listener
        ws.OnClose += (WebSocketCloseCode code) =>
        {
            Debug.Log("WS closed with code: " + code.ToString());
        };

        // Connect to the server
        ws.Connect();

    }
    
    // Update is called once per frame
    void Update () {
        
    }
}
```

## Error Handling

When any error occours during method call then the `WebSocketException` is thrown. Unified both for native and browser client so you can catch it in your C# code.
